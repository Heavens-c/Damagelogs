# Damagelogs
what purpose of this script? 

Instead of sending people direct messages, I mentioned to several people on the forum that I had the damage logs. I later discovered that some people were selling it. 
I therefore made the decision to make it public. 

Hit every player to deal damage to them and record your damage! Since many players use damage modifiers or what they refer to as "aim bots," my server—and technically most servers—is built using this script.

You can change webhook on damage-sv.lua

to your own webhook


my road map on this to add a Who Player Fire a Gun  and connect to  damage logs! since i decided to revert the code .. i'm trying to figure out how to log damage continuesly 


if you have an idea or improve this help me out create A PR
