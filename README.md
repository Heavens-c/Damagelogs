# Damagelogs
what purpose of this script? 
alot of people on forum i said i have the damage logs so here you go instead of dm's people and i heard some people selling it 
so i decided to release it to public 

Hit each player to cause them to take damage in order to record your damage! Since many players have damage modifiers or what they call "aim bots," my server, or technically most servers, are based on this script.

You can change webhook on damage-sv.lua

to your own webhook


my road map on this to add a Who Player Fire a Gun  and connect to  damage logs! since i decided to revert the code .. i'm trying to figure out how to log damage continuesly 


if you have an idea or improve this help me out create A PR
